# MultiTypeAdapter

## What is it?

This is an adapter to be used with the Android RecyclerView. This adapter allows for multiple item 
types to be shown in a RecyclerView.

## How does it work?

There are 4 main components:
- MultiTypeAdapter
- TypeAdapter
- TypeAdapterFactory
- Items

<b>MultiTypeAdapter:</b> This extends the RecyclerView.Adapter and takes in a list of TypeAdapters. You use
this class to set/update the adapter data.

<b>TypeAdapter:</b> This is an interface that mimics the required methods typically overridden in a
RecyclerView.Adapter.

<b>TypeAdapterFactory:</b> Creates custom implementations of the TypeAdapter using a functional approach.

<b>Items:</b> This is a simple wrapper around a list of Objects. Any data you want to put into the
adapter can easily be constructed using Items.

## How do I get it?

#### Gradle:
````
compile 'com.iheartradio.android:mt-adapter:0.1.1'
````

## Usage:

#### Create a standard ViewHolder:
````
public class MyViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {

    TextView mText;

    public MyViewHolder(View itemView) {
        super(itemView);
        mText = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.text);
    }

    public static MyViewHolder create(final ViewGroup parent) {
        return new MyViewHolder(LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.list_item, parent, false));
    }

    public void bindData(final String data) {
        mText.setText(data);
    }
}
````

#### Create TypeAdapter:
````
TypeAdapter myTypeAdapter = TypeAdapterFactory.create(String.class, 
                                                            MyViewHolder::create,
                                                            MyViewHolder::bindData);
````
In this case we are creating a type adapter that maps strings to our MyViewHolder class.
The first param is the data type, second is a method to create the viewholder, and third a 
method to bind the data from the first param to the viewholder.

Instead of using the TypeAdapterFactory we can just implement TypeAdapter ourselves like so:

````
public class MyTypeAdapter extends TypeAdapter<String, MyViewHolder> {

    @Override
    public boolean isMyData(Object data) {
        return data instanceof String;
    }

    @Override
    public MyViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(final ViewGroup parent) {
        return MyViewHolder.create(parent);
    }

    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(final MyViewHolder viewHolder,
                                 final String data,
                                 final List<Object> payloads) {
        viewHolder.bind(data);
    }
}
````


#### Create MultiTypeAdapter:

````
MultiTypeAdapter adapter = new MultiTypeAdapter(myTypeAdapter);
````
We create the MultiTypeAdapter by passing our TypeAdapter into the constructor. The adapter
is now going to map String data passed to it to the specified viewholder.

#### Set Data:
````
Items items = Items();
items.add("Item 1");
items.add("Item 2");
items.add("Item 3");
adapter.setData(items);

````
